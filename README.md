## digiRhythm

digiRhythm is an R library developed at Agroscope and provides a set of
tools to analyze and visualize the rhythmic behavior of animals. It mainly focuses
on the Degree of Functional Coupling (0 < DFC < 1), a measure used by several scientists
to assess the welfare of animals. The library also provides tools to compute the diurnality
index, to visualize the actogram and the average activity.

This repository contains the most updated version of the library, while the CRAN package and its vignettes could be found at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=digiRhythm).

The library is still under development and we are working on adding more functionalities to it. If you have any suggestions or you want to contribute to the library, please feel free to contact us.
