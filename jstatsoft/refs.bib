abstract = {Summary
Reducing stress during handling will improve productivity and prevent physiological changes that could confound research results or lower productivity. Handling stresses lower conception rates and reduces both immune and rumen function. Handlers who understand livestock behavior can reduce stress. Livestock have wide angle vision and they are easily frightened by shadows or moving distractions outside of chutes. Solid sides on chutes will reduce agitation and excitement. Noise should be kept to a minimum because animals have sensitive hearing. When wild cattle or sheep are handled the handler should work on the edge of the flight zone to avoid agitation. Cattle, pigs, and sheep are herd animals and isolation of a single individual should be avoided. An animal's previous experience with handling will affect its reaction to handling in the future. Animals which have had frequent gentle contact with people will be less stressed during handling than animals which have had previous aversive treatment. Livestock can be trained to voluntarily enter a restraining device. The restraint device should be gradually introduced and should not cause pain. Feed rewards will facilitate training. Training animals to voluntarily submit to handling procedures would be especially useful for valuable breeding animals and animals used for research.}

Melatonin levels were determined from the first day of hospitalization and up to three days after the onset of delirium. Patients who did not developed delirium exhibited a daily melatonin rhythm, while in patients that developed delirium, the melatonin rhythm was lost and mean melatonin levels were found decreased as early as three days before the diagnosis of delirium, indicating that on arrival to the hospital circadian melatonin disruption can be used as an indicator of delirium.}

abstract={A biorhythmical method has been developed to assess behavior patterns and to evaluate the living conditions of animals that can be applied also to humans. All kinds of continuous and equidistant long-term recordings of behavior are suitable for this method. Time functions from an automatic telemetry system (ETHOSYSII) were analyzed macroscopically (comparison of daily levels) and microscopically (autocorrelation function and power spectral analysis). Degrees of functional coupling (DFCs) were calculated to identify and evaluate disturbances in behavior. Hierarchic frequency tuning of complex rhythmic functions of behaviors, leads primarily to period lengths that are synchronized with the 24-h period. DFCs, a measure of harmony between internal rhythms and the external 24-h period, were found to be high in well-adapted, healthy, and undisturbed individuals but were lowered during periods of adaptation, sickness, or social interaction. Specific stress conditions could be identified and evaluated in several species, under various conditions, using these biorhythmic analyses.},
